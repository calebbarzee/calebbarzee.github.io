## Why Resumes?

The resume is an elevator pitch in written form.

Why should I care? Well, the objective truth is that resumes are used ubiquitously. There is no avoiding writing a resume if you want to land a job.

So what, is a resume? Well, it's a condensed bit of information about you, your character, skills, and history. There seems to be something about us as humans that causes our desire to condense information. I like to think that is due to the increased efficiency in disseminating information, but I don't know for sure.

In my conversations with others about crafting a resume, the discussion always turns back to story. Humans are storytellers. We connect easily with characters that fit a singular story.

This is why I describe a resume as a written elevator pitch. You must write/tell a story about yourself that quickly conveys to the reader, who you are, what you do, and maybe a touch of why you do it.

## Crafting My Resume

The most valuable information I can give in this article is my personal experience in crafting my resume. I don't propose to be some type of recruitment or career expert, but I will share what I've learned.

### Telling a Story

Crafting a resume is akin to narrating your professional journey. You're not just listing experiences and skills; you're weaving a narrative that highlights your unique value proposition. By crafting a compelling story, you engage the reader and make a memorable impression.

### Writing with My Goals in Mind

When crafting my resume, I kept my career goals at the forefront. Every section, bullet point, and word was chosen with intention. By aligning my resume with my objectives, I ensured that it effectively communicated my aspirations and positioned me as a strong candidate for the roles I was targeting.

It's actually great to craft your resume around what you want. This was a fundamental misunderstanding I had. I thought that my employer doesn't care about what I want, but they actually really want to know what you want. This is because if your motivations align with their needs then it's far easier to create a mutually beneficial work relationship. They want to hear just how much you care about what you do, because they benefit directly from what you do.

### Writing with My Future Employer's Goals in Mind

In addition to considering my own goals, I also put myself in the shoes of my future employer. What are they looking for in a candidate? What pain points do they need to address? By tailoring my resume to address these questions, I demonstrated my understanding of their needs and my ability to provide solutions.

When applying to fill a role at a company, you're asking to be utilized to fulfill the company's needs. If you can't demonstrate that you understand what these needs are, they'll feel less confident that you are actually going to get the job done. Yes, you work under their direction and orders, but the more you can be self sufficient in fulfilling their requests the better, because this liberates their valuable management resources from having to constantly guide you to other problems (like nailing a 10yd putt, I'm only kidding). You should deeply understand what a company's mission, objectives, and struggles are so that you can help them feel confident you'll be a great fit and get the job done.

### Simplifying

In a world inundated with information, simplicity is key. I aimed to streamline my resume, focusing on the most relevant and impactful details. By presenting information concisely and clearly, I made it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to quickly grasp my qualifications and potential fit for their organization.

Cut out anything that feels remotely unnecessary. It feels counter-intuitive, but if it's not your best stuff, it's actually better it's left out instead of distracting from your core message. A good general rule of thumb is to keep it to one page.

### The Boring Formatting Bits

I selected a simple san-serif typeface to be used in my resume. Does that matter? Not a whole lot, but I wanted to share my reasoning why. I selected this because I assumed that primarily my resume would be via a digital interface. I don't walk in to a company's headquarters and give them a paper copy of my resume. I upload my pdf and fill out a view questions. I wanted to eliminate as many obstacles as possible that hinder the reader in getting my core message. It may not be the traditional formatting, but I feel like it better conveys who I am and how I tick.

I opted to not split my paper, instead I left aligned almost everything and wrote it like I would any other document. It's not meant to be showy, it's meant to describe exactly what I've done and my skill set. I'd rather those things impress the reader than my flashy document formatting prowess.

I included not just plain text but hyperlinks for my email, linkedin, and portfolio (which subsequently informs the reader of my github username). This again is due to the digital nature of the world we live in. I want someone reading my resume to have quick access to any additional information they may want. 

Lastly, I tried to optimize for text parsing software. For instance I frequently am given the option on a website to upload my resume and it will then auto-fill many of the applications form inputs. Previously, my resume was formatted with dates for a human to read, so the software struggled to properly parse the start and end dates of my various work experience or education. I changed to a more simplistic and widely accepted date format (mm/yyyy) in order for my resume to be parsed properly, thus saving me some time and headache. There are other optimizations for machines reading your resume that you may want to make for instance, including keywords to pass ATS filters. However, I will not be discussing these techniques here.

## Conclusion

I thought that writing a resume was a lot more about conforming to established protocols, and robotically reciting information about yourself. I was wrong. Crafting a resume is all about making something that is a reflection of you. It should impress upon the reader who you are, what you do, and how you do things. In a world of bland repeats, you can be the unique, by telling your story.
