        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>
          The target audience for Sonorous Forecasts are presumptuous people
          aged 20-60 years old. They are those people that are "too good" for
          conventional weather sites. They are individuals that not only care
          what information is presented to them, but also how that information
          is presented.
        </p>
        <h2>Personas:</h2>
        <h3>Janessa</h3>
        <p>
          Janessa frequently flies from Paris, France to Florence, Italy to
          purchase textiles for her designer clothing brand. She wants an
          elegant way to know what the weather is going to be like in the city
          she's arriving.
        </p>
        <h3>Edward</h3>
        <p>
          Edward likes to frequently sun bath at his villa in the Virgin
          Islands. However, he doesn't wish to go through the hassle of ordering
          his staff to prepare his private jet unless, there's a forecast of at
          least four days of uninterrupted sun.
